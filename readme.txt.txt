Our file is manual. I do not have a method by which the program asks a secondary client for a file,
although each of the individual functions can be demonstrated. The project lacks multithreading, although
multiple clients can be connected without disconnected the previous (up to 5). I have included sample files which
can demonstrably be uploaded from client to server, downloaded from server to client, and deleted from the client,
and the directory can be shown.

The program will ask you for your choice of operation.
It will then ask you for a filename where appropriate.
It will then commence operation and display a progress bar which should tell you the time elapsed.
The program often freezes here for an undeterminable reason (by me at least).
It may not allow you to, in one run of the program, test all the functions. However, I have verified that
they all will work.
